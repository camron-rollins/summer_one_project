  <p>Reflection:<br/>Fedrick Doulgass</p>
  <hr></hr>
  <p>Quote:“I prefer to be true to myself, even at the hazard of incurring the ridicule of others, rather than to be false, and to incur my own abhorrence.” - Fredrick Douglass</p>
  <hr></hr>
  <p>Key words: Allies</p>
  <p></p>
  <hr></hr>
  <p>Writing:<br/>What the quote is trying to say is that it is better to stay honest to yourself than to change for the better of others that do not care for you or your well being. But they want to change identity as a person. What Fredrick is trying to say is that there is no reason to change you personality identity.</p>

  <p>Quote:“I must get my soul back from you; I am killing my flesh without it.” “Whenever I hear anyone arguing for slavery, I feel a strong impulse to see it tried on him personally.” - Fredrick Douglass</p>
  <hr />
  <p>Key words:Jim Crow laws</p>
  <p></p>
  <hr />
  <p>Writing:<br/>For over 400 years slavery was legal. Our African names have been abolished and our ancestors went through hell. Our schools don't even teach their students to the point where people think Africa is a country. They'd rather talk about the culinary foods that America has instead all talking about the people who made that food so famous and delicious.</p>

  <p>Reflection:<br/>Being prepared</p>
  <hr />
  <p>Quote:"It is better to be prepared for an oppurtunity and not have one than to have an oppurtunity and not be prepared" - Whitney M. Young</p>
  <hr />
  <p>Key words:oppurtunity</p>
  <p></p>
  <hr />
  <p>Writing:<br/>What this Mr. Young is trying to say is that we should always be prepared for any situation that comes our way. For it is better to prepare for a situation even if it doesn’t happen than to not be prepared and it comes your way

  <p>Reflection:<br>Black women</p>

  <p>Quote:“The most disrespected woman in America, is the Black woman. The most unprotected in America is the Black woman. The most neglected person in America is the Black woman”- Malcom X</p>

  <p>Key words:Toxic Masculinity</p>

  <p>Writing:<br>To be a man you have to be responsible, be able to sacrifice things for loved ones, be able to run the house, and be able to contribute to the family. These are the things I feel are the most important attributes that a man needs especially in the society we live in now.

  <p>Reflection:<br>What does it mean to be a man</p>
  <hr/>
  <p>Quote:"A "real man" is someone who isn't afraid to show how he feels even if it means that he has to cry. Our definition of a "real man /woman" would be totally different from our grandparents definition because back then there was only "real men" because women had no sort of power." - Katherine Schulten</p>
  <hr/>
  <p>Key words:Sacrifice</p>
  <p></p>
